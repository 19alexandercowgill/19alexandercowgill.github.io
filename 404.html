A page lost, its presence overthrown.
In this empty space, time hangs still,
Questions echo, but silence fills.

Take a breath, but don't expect ease,
In this void, the answers tease.
Exhale slow, let the fog unwind,
For in this darkness, truth is blind.

Rest here for a fleeting while,
In the absence, find your trial.
Not all journeys end in light,
Some lead deeper into the night.

When you're ready, make your move,
But tread carefully, for paths can soothe,
Or spiral into the unknown ahead—
Where even answers may be dead.

Take your breath and trust the way,
The next turn waits, though it may stray.
The web, like shadows, twists and turns—
A place where nothing stays or burns.`,

            `Where we are, there's only air,
A page misplaced, it isn't there.
In the void where data fades,
Questions linger, answers evade.
Not all paths lead where we care.`,

            `A place forgotten, lost in time,
Where silence speaks, and echoes climb.
A missing page, a ghostly trace,
A corner turned, an empty space.

We wander here, with hopes unknown,
Chasing answers, but none are shown.
The void consumes, the data slips,
And in the dark, the error grips.`,

            `You've arrived at a place unclear,
Where nothing waits, yet all is near.
The page you seek has slipped away,
Into the ether, lost today.

No path to follow, no guide to find,
Just emptiness, but peace of mind.
So breathe and let your search now cease,
For in this void, there is release.`,
