        <div id="comp-1">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>The CPU, using the Von Neumann Architecture can only execute one instruction at a time. This is slow, especially when many programs need millions of instructions</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="comp-2">
            <h3>Clock Speed</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>Modern processors can run at 3GHz+, meaning 3 billion clock cycles per second</p>
                <p>But older processors did not have this luxury, and many still have speeds of 1.2GHz</p>
                <p>Increasing the clock speed allows for more instructions to be done in the same amount of time.</p>
                <p>However, there isnt a 1:1 relationship between clock speed and instructions executed</p>
            </div>

        </div>


        <div id="comp-3">
            <h3>Number of Cores</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>A core is, in the most simple sense, an entire copy of a CPU.</p>
                <p>A Quad (4) core processor would have 4 CUs, 4 ALUs, but may have a shared cache. </p>
                <p>Just like <a href="#comp-2">Clock Speed</a>, doubling the cores does <b>not</b> double the speed - the cores have to "talk" with each other, which takes some time, moreover, most programs are not designed with multi core in mind</p>

            </div>

        </div>
        <div id="comp-4">
            <h3>RAM Size</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary storage for programs and data being used by the CPU.</p>
                <p>More RAM allows for more programs and larger datasets to run simultaneously without relying on slower storage like SSDs or hard drives.</p>
                <p>Insufficient RAM leads to frequent swapping between RAM and storage, significantly reducing performance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id="comp-5">
            <h3>Register Size</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>Registers are small, fast storage locations inside the CPU that hold data for immediate use in calculations.</p>
                <p>The size of a register (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) determines how much data the CPU can process at once.</p>
                <p>A larger register size enables the CPU to handle larger numbers and addresses, which improves performance in modern applications.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id="comp-6">
            <h3>Data Bus Width</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>The data bus connects the CPU to memory and other components, allowing data to travel between them.</p>
                <p>The width of the data bus (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) determines how many bits can be transferred at once.</p>
                <p>A wider data bus increases data throughput, reducing the time needed to fetch or store data.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id="comp-7">
            <h3>Data Bus Speed</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>Data bus speed refers to how quickly the bus can transfer data between components.</p>
                <p>It is measured in Hertz (e.g., MHz, GHz) and works alongside the data bus width to determine overall bandwidth.</p>
                <p>A faster data bus minimizes delays in data transfer, ensuring the CPU spends less time waiting for data.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id="comp-8">
            <h3>Offloading</h3>
            <div class="overview-content education">
                <p>Offloading refers to delegating tasks to specialized hardware to reduce the CPU's workload.</p>
                <p>For example, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) handles graphical computations, freeing the CPU for other tasks.</p>
                <p>Other examples include network cards for communication and co-processors for intensive calculations like AI or physics simulations.</p>
