                <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Encryption is the method in which data can be kept secure while it is being transmitted, essentially providing intruders/interceptors with unusable nonsense. There are a few ways in which this can be achieved, though it is important to note the data is still <em>readable</em>, just not legible. </p>
                <h3 id="key">Key</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of encryption depends upon secret keys, which are shared secret pieces of data.</li>
                    <li>Keys are made up of a pair of very large prime numbers, either 256 or 1,024 bits long.</li>
                    <li>It would take an impractical amount of time to guess the key. So we say that the encryption is secure.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="sym">Symmetric</h3>
                <p>Both computers share the same key, this is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Getting the key is somewhat finnicky - if that key is intercepted, the whole process is worthless. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both client and server share the same key</li>
                    <li>Using a single key to encrypt and decrypt text proposes a massive flaw in security, as anyone with the key can decrypt the cypher.</li>
                    <li>As with passwords, the longer the encryption key, the less likely it is to be compromised by brute force, and so the more secure the encryption.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="asy">Asymmetric</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asymmetric or public key encryption is a much stronger form of encryption and uses two keys: a public and a private key.</li>
                    <li>The public key is given to anyone who wishes to send you encrypted data.</li>
                    <li>This public key can only be used to encrypt information and not decrypt the information.</li>
                    <li>The private key is used to decrypt the data, and only you have this key.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This method uses the knowledge that the keys are mathematically related to each other, though it is impossible to derive one from the other still.</p>
