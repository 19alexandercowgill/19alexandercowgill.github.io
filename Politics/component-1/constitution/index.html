            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <div class="keyword">
                <p>Codified - A Constitution in which all provisions are written down in a single set of documents, for
                    example the US constitution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="keyword">
                <p>Uncodified - A Constitution that is not contained in a single set of documents, for example the
                    British Constitution</p>
            </div>
            <h3 id="whats-a-constitution">What is a Constitution?</h3>
            <p>A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents that define the structure,
                powers, and duties of a government. It outlines the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the
                rules for how the state operates. Constitutions can be written (Codified) or unwritten (Uncodified), and
                they serve as the highest legal authority in a country.</p>

                    <p>Conventions aren't written down, but are generally agreed rules and procedures</p>
                    <p>An example is the Royal Assent, where the bills must be passed through the monarch</p>

                    <p>There was 63 clauses, now only 4 are relevant</p>

                    <p>Before the UK left the EU in Jan 2020, EU laws such as the Lisbon Treaty took precedence over
                        laws passed by Westminster and were binding on the UK government.
                        This represented a clear limit on parliamentary sovereignty</p>

                    <p>In modern times, The Royal Prerogative could be seen as a key factor in boosting the powers of

                        Brexit
                    </h4>

                    <h4>Extension of the powers of the Supreme Court</h4>
                    <p>During the Brexit process, the UK Supreme Court's powers were extended, particularly around
                        limiting the prerogative powers of the Prime Minister. This includes the controversial case in
                        2019 where the Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's prorogation (suspending) of
                        Parliament was unlawful. This was seen as a way of limiting the executive's ability to bypass
                        Parliament during the Brexit debates.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme Court in itself is smaller, more diverse and much less conservative dominated</p>

                    <h4>Regional Mayors</h4>
                    <p>There is now greater power and autonomy in larger cities</p>
                    <p>This has been criticised for being too much power in the unelected</p>

                <div class="example-card" tabindex="0">
                    <h4>Regional Councils</h4>
                    <p>1986, Margaret Thatcher abolished regional councils, such as Greater Manchester Council, or
                        Merseyside Council. This was replaced with smaller ones such as Manchester City Council and
                        other local governance. This was because Labour had a large amount of control over those
                        councils, which Thatcher viewed as a threat</p>

                    <p>The Speaker of Commons, John Bercow (now Linsday Hoyle) did not like the way that Brexit was
                        handled, and ensured the Government was properly scrutinised</p>

                    <p>London was granted an elected mayor in 1998</p>
                    <p>Under the Cameron Coalition, this was expanded to all cities, to provide local governance, and
                        direct accountability</p>
